# About-me
Information about me.
- Hi! I'm **@EstevaoAZ**, I'm a *19 year old Computer Science student from Brazil;*
- I'm currently on an intern job;
- I look for working remotely for a foreign company;
- I speak two languages: Portuguese (my mother tongue) and English (fluent, learned it by myself);
- I am very creative and passionate about IT stuff, I've been in love with it since I was a little kid :);
- I like heavy metal and some jazz and classical music;
- I'm a die-hard Lord Of The Rings fan (like my pfp wasn't Sauron's eye lol);
- I'm in college, my course is called "engenharia de software", which directly translates to "software engineering", but it's just normal Computer Science (I'll become a software engineer anyways);
- I'm currently learning Python, but I know a little of Javascript, HTML3 and CSS5. I look forward to becoming a front-end developer. My main goal is full-stack though;
- Ummmm... That's it! Thanks for visiting my profile and feel free to contact me! Have a nice day!
